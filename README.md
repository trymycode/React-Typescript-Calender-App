# Pre-Interview Development Exercise

The following is a practical programming test designed to allow you to showcase your development skills and form a point of technical discussion in any forthcoming interview.

We expect you will be able to submit the "correct" solution, so we are looking for coding standards and techniques that stand out.

You should submit a complete, well-thought-out solution and are advised to pay particular attention to the requirements. This exercise should take no more than 2 hours.

Good Luck!

## React Calendar

An organisation is building a React component library, which various front-end React solutions can import and use in their projects.

A new reusable calendar component has been requested to add to the component library: `<Calendar date={someDate} />`. Your task is to implement this component.

This component should use the date prop and render a simple calendar for the given date's year and month, with its date highlighted. See [cal-2022-10-03.png](./cal-2022-10-03.png) for an example of what the calendar component might render if the date of 03/10/2022 was passed in as a prop. Likewise, a calendar with a date prop of 23/03/2020 might render [cal-2020-03-23.png](./cal-2020-03-23.png).

You may implement this component in React TypeScript or React JavaScript. You may use CSS modules or any other style or class utility library, such as TailwindCSS, for styling. You may use an appropriate bootstrapping tool, such as Create React App, to get started:

`npx create-react-app cal --template typescript`

## Requirements

- A reusable calendar component which has a `date` prop.
- The first row of the calendar should display the `date` prop's month and year.
- The second row of the calendar should display the days of the week, one per column.
- The following rows should display the dates for the `date` prop's month and year, appropriately aligned with the day headings.
- The appropriate date cell should be highlighted based on the `date` prop.

Pay attention to the following:

- Showing the component can take a date prop and renders the correct calendar through a set of component tests. You may use tools such as `react-testing-library` to achieve this, or other methods.
- Good code and component separation of concerns.
- Careful consideration of what types are used in the solution.
- Suitable use of JavaScript libraries and functional programming techniques where appropriate.
- Clear and easy to understand JavaScript / TypeScript code.
